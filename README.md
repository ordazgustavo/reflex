# What's the diference?

Support for `setState` callbacks:

```js
this.setState(
  prevState => ({
    count: prevState.count + 1
  }),
  () => console.log(this.state)
);
```

Reflex includes support for fragments, so you can avoid using `div`'s to wrap components

```js
import Reflex, { Fragment } from '../reflex';

export const paragraph = ({ title, children }) => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{children}</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
```

Removed

```js
componentWillMount();
componentWillUpdate();
componentWillReceiveProps();
```
